## Projects
- :briefcase: "CryptoSafe: Safeguarding Your Investments with Advanced Layered and Conjugated LSTM False Cryptocurrency Detection"
  ``` 
  This project aims to detect 11 types of false Crypto keys using LSTM and Conjugated LSTM models. 
  The models were trained on a large dataset of Crypto keys, and the results showed that the LSTM model achieved a final accuracy of 90%.
  The Conjugated LSTM model had an accuracy of 86%, which is better than the other models suggested.

- :briefcase: Breakout Game | A3C Game
``` 
This project is a Breakout Game created using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm developed by Google DeepMind. 
The game is trained by an agent that chooses the next state, while the critic evaluates the agent's performance.

- :briefcase: :lock: SatCNNRPN | Object Detection in Satellite Imagery
```
The SatCNNRPN model is designed to detect multiscale objects in satellite imagery, which is a crucial task for various applications in fields such as weather forecasting, urban planning, and natural resource management.  
The model incorporates Convolutional Neural Networks and Regional Proposal Networks to achieve high accuracy in object detection. 
The project focuses on three major datasets, the Stanford Drone Dataset, Airbus Aircraft Dataset, and Inria Aerial Imagery Dataset, which are commonly used in the field of satellite imagery.
Compared to other backbone architectures used for the same purpose, SatCNNRPN achieved a higher level of accuracy, making it a state-of-the-art model in this field.

- :briefcase: Exploratory Data Analysis of Online Video Streaming Platforms
```
The project aimed to conduct an analysis of the three major OTT platforms, namely Disney+ Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix. 
The analysis involved collecting data about user engagement, the number of available titles, and the quality of content across the three platforms. 
The results of the analysis revealed some interesting insights into the performance of these platforms.
